# nbninteractivetutorials

Code with comments written for North by Northwestern's interactive section. We hold meetings every Sunday at 3pm via Zoom, where we check in on-going articles & different ways to create interactive articles with HTML/CSS/JS.

No previous coding experience is necessary, if you're interested in creating interactive articles, send me an email at amyguo2023@u.northwestern.edu!
